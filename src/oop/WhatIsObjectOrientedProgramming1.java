         * Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
         *
         * Class - A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects
         * are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common
         * to all objects of one type.
         *
         * Object - An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object
         * contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
         *
         * What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and
         * object-based programming language? Object-based programming language follows
         * all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are
         * examples of object-based programming languages.
         *
         * Why Java is not a purely Object-Oriented Language?
         *
         * Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully
         * Object Oriented Language which supports or have features which treats
         * everything inside program as objects.
         *
         * Because
         *
         * 1 - Primitive Data Type ex. int, long, bool, float, char, etc
         *
         * 2-The static keyword: When we declares a class as static then it can be used
         * without the use of an object in Java. If we are using static function or
         * static variable then we can call that function or variable by using dot(.)
         * or class object defying object oriented feature.
         *
         * What happens if the main() method is written without String args[]? The
         * program will compile, but not run, because JVM will not recognize the main()
         * method. Remember JVM always looks for the main() method with a string type
         * array as a parameter.
         *
         * Execution Process ( Important )
         *
         * First, JVM executes the static block, then it executes static methods, and
         * then it creates the object needed by the program. Finally, it executes the
         * instance methods. JVM executes a static block on the highest priority basis.
         * It means JVM first goes to static block even before it looks for the main()
         * method in the program.

         OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)
         Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
         Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
         It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

         Object
         Class
         Inheritance
         Polymorphism
         Abstraction
         Encapsulation

         Inheritance
         When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance.
         It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

         Polymorphism
         If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
         For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

         In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

         Abstraction
         Hiding internal implementation and showing functionality only to the user is known as abstraction.
         For example, phone call, we do not know the internal processing.

         In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

         Encapsulation
         Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
         For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

         A Java class is the example of encapsulation.
         Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.
