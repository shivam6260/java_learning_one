         CamelCase in Java Naming Conventions
         Java follows the camel-case syntax for naming the class, interface, method, and variable.

         1. Classes and Interfaces: PascalCase (Upper CamelCase):
         Each word starts with an uppercase letter. This style is used for naming classes and interfaces.
         Examples: ActionEvent, ActionListener, EmployeeDetails, AccountManager.

         2. Methods and Variables: CamelCase (Lower CamelCase):
         The first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
         This style is used for naming methods and variables.
         Examples: actionPerformed(), firstName, calculateInterest(), accountBalance.
