		/*
		 * Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.
		 * 
		 * Class - A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects
		 * are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common
		 * to all objects of one type.
		 * 
		 * Object - An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object
		 * contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
		 * 
		 * What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and
		 * object-based programming language? Object-based programming language follows
		 * all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are
		 * examples of object-based programming languages.
		 * 
		 * Why Java is not a purely Object-Oriented Language?
		 * 
		 * Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully
		 * Object Oriented Language which supports or have features which treats
		 * everything inside program as objects.
		 * 
		 * Because
		 * 
		 * 1 - Primitive Data Type ex. int, long, bool, float, char, etc
		 * 
		 * 2-The static keyword: When we declares a class as static then it can be used
		 * without the use of an object in Java. If we are using static function or
		 * static variable then we canï¿½t call that function or variable by using dot(.)
		 * or class object defying object oriented feature.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * What happens if the main() method is written without String args[]? The
		 * program will compile, but not run, because JVM will not recognize the main()
		 * method. Remember JVM always looks for the main() method with a string type
		 * array as a parameter.
		 * 
		 * Execution Process ( Important )
		 * 
		 * First, JVM executes the static block, then it executes static methods, and
		 * then it creates the object needed by the program. Finally, it executes the
		 * instance methods. JVM executes a static block on the highest priority basis.
		 * It means JVM first goes to static block even before it looks for the main()
		 * method in the program.
