		/*
		 * Class Detail =
		 * 
		 * A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are
		 * created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to
		 * all objects of one type.
		 * 
		 * In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:
		 * 
		 * Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access class
		 * 
		 * keyword: class keyword is used to create a class.
		 * 
		 * Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by
		 * convention).
		 * 
		 * Superclass(if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any,
		 * preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one
		 * parent.
		 * 
		 * Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the
		 * class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more
		 * than one interface.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Object Details -
		 * 
		 * It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real
		 * life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you
		 * know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :
		 * 
		 * State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the
		 * properties of an object.
		 * 
		 * Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the
		 * response of an object with other objects.
		 * 
		 * Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to
		 * interact with other objects.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Anonymous objects --
		 * 
		 * Anonymous objects are the objects that are instantiated but are not stored in
		 * a reference variable.
		 * 
		 * They are used for immediate method calling.
		 * 
		 * They will be destroyed after method calling.
		 * 
		 * They are widely used in different libraries.
		 * 
		 * Instance Variable -
		 * 
		 * Instance variable in Java A variable which is created inside the class but
		 * outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable
		 * doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object
		 * or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.
		 * 
		 * The Default value of Instance variable is null. agar tum initialise nai kie
		 * tabbhi koi dikkat nahi hai lekin default value of local variable kuch nahi
		 * hota agar usko bina initialise kie use kie toh error aa jayega.
		 * 
		 * NEW Keyword-
		 * 
		 * new keyword in Java The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime.
		 * All objects get memory in Heap memory area.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Talking about Access Specifiers ( private , public protected and default )
		 * not about Keyword
		 * 
		 * In Java, methods and data members can be encapsulated by the following four
		 * access specifiers. The access specifiers are listed according to their
		 * restrictiveness order.
		 * 
		 * 1) private (accessible within the class where defined)
		 * 
		 * 2) default or package-private (when no access specifier is specified)
		 * 
		 * 3) protected (accessible only to classes that subclass your class directly
		 * within the current or different package)
		 * 
		 * 4) public (accessible from any class)
		 * 
		 * Mtlb Jo Outer class hai usme kewal Public and default hi laga sakte.
		 * 
		 * Nested interfaces and classes can have all access specifiers. Note: We cannot
		 * declare class/interface with private or protected access specifiers.
		 * 
		 * But, the classes and interfaces themselves can have only two access
		 * specifiers when declared outside any other class. 1) public 2) default (when
		 * no access specifier is specified)
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Naming Convention - Note:
		 * 
		 * For class and interfaces, the first letter has to be uppercase. For method ,
		 * variable, package_name, and constants, the first letter has to be lowercase.
